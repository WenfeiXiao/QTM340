Last week we learned that language processing -- and text processing by extension -- is difficult 
for three reasons:

- Ambiguity (e.g., The chicken is ready to eat) 
- Change and variation (e.g., idk what's wrong with me frfr)
- Shared context (e.g., Braves are playing at home tonight)


Your task is to find one example from either Google News headlines or X (formerly Twitter) that illustrates 
each of the above. For each example, give a brief explanation (not more than 2-3 sentences) of what makes the 
example difficult for text models to understand.
