Trevor has just learned about clustering and topic modeling and he is eager to apply 
it on a project in class.He applies LDA and KMeans clustering on a small text collection. 
Assume that he fixes the number of clusters and the number of topics to the same value.

He extracts a list of top 5 words that are strongly associated with each topic and each cluster, respectively.
Explain in 3-4 sentences the similarities and differences that he will see with the lists obtained from topic modeling 
to those obtained from clustering.
