In this homework, we will do an annotation task.

Below are a set of 20 text excerpts taken from books. 
Each expert contains a span of text that references a character and another span of text that references a place.
Your annotation task is to label the spatial relationship between the character and the place.
The actual label for each example can be one of the three:

- IN : if the character is judged to be strictly inside the place at the present time
- NOT IN: if the character is judged not to be strictly inside the place at the present time or there is no relation between the character and the place.
