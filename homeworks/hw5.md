Rose is debugging a problem she is facing with K-means algorithm. 
She had collected four movie scripts and represented every movie 
with a 2-D vector. In a 2-D plane, the vectors were:

* 1,1 (Joker)
* 9,1 (Iron Man)
* 9,3 (Avengers)
* 1,3 (The Dark Knight)

Notice that the four points in the 2-D plane form a rectangle.

She thought she'd apply k-means on this tiny dataset. 
She set K=2 and initialized the centroids to (5,1) and (5,3).

Q1. If each cluster she gets is of size 2, which movies will be clustered together?
Q2. Based on the data -- particularly the geoemtry of the data -- which movies should ideally be clustered together? 
Q3. If the answers to Q1 and Q2 are different, what would you change to get the desired clusters?
